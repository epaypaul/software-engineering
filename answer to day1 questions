question2. 
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
Context: Before the late 1960s, software development was often chaotic and ad-hoc, leading to the "software crisis"—projects were late, over budget, or failed entirely.
Milestone: The term "software engineering" was coined at the 1968 NATO Conference in Garmisch, Germany. Experts recognized the need for disciplined, systematic approaches to software development, akin to traditional engineering.

2. Structured Programming and Methodologies (1970s–1980s)
Key Developments:Structured Programming: Pioneered by Edsger Dijkstra and others, this emphasized modular, logical code design (e.g., loops, conditionals) to reduce complexity and errors.
Waterfall Model: Introduced by Winston Royce in 1970, it formalized the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with sequential phases (requirements, design, implementation, testing).

3.Agile and DevOps (2001–Present)
Milestone: The Agile Manifesto (2001) revolutionized software development by prioritizing flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress over rigid planning. Later, DevOps (2008–2010s) merged development and operations to enable continuous delivery.
Key Principles:Agile: Customer feedback, adaptive planning, and sprints (e.g., Scrum, Kanban).
DevOps: Automation, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Jenkins, Docker).
